<h1>The Majestic Dumbo Octopus</h1>
<p>The dumbo octopus lives in deeper waters than any other octopus, and is rarely encountered. Lacking an ink sac, it uses its color-changing chromatophores to camouflage itself from predators, like many cephalopods. Their movements can be odd at times, using their arms to crawl along the ocean floor, or their ear-like fins to flap through the murky depths.</p>
